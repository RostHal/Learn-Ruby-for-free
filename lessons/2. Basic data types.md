# What is Variable?
          
A variable is an identifier or name that can be assigned to a value that is of type during program execution of a program.


The Identifier is a common name. Ruby uses Identifiers for assignment
names for variables, methods, classes and so on.

Constants are diagnostics starting with a capital letter. Use constants
to access a single persistent object.


Examples of variables:

To print the value to the screen use the "puts".


To display the value of a variable, you need to write the name of the variable

To write constants, you need to write the variable name with a capital letter:

Constant = 32

# What is Data types?

A data type is a set of valid values that one or another can take
an object, as well as the set of valid operations that apply to it. In modern
Understanding the type also depends on the internal presentation of the information.

There is no direct type declaration in Ruby. It simply assigns values to variables.
Ruby automatically makes type declarations, which is called dynamic typing.

Everything in Ruby is an object. So are data types: all belong to the Object class.

* Fixnum (whole numbers, less 2^30),
* Bignum (whole numbers, greater than 2^30),
* Float (floating point numbers),
* Array (array),
* String (string),
* Hash (associative arrays).
