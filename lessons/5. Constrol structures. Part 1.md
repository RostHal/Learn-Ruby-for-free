# Algorithm concept

An algorithm is a set of instructions describing the order of the executor's actions.
to achieve the result you want.

Algorithms are divided into:

* Linear algorithms are algorithms in which a set of instructions
is performed strictly in order and once.

* Branching algorithms are algorithms that have at least one operator
branching, after the execution of which the next
sequence of instructions to execute.

# What are conditional constructs?

Conditional construct is basic
a construct that contains conditions, and
on the progress of this condition and
the subsequent work of all
designs (performance of certain
instructions).

Such structures include structures:
if, if-else, if-else-if, if-elsif, case, unless, and ternary operator.

# If

The most common condition is the if condition.

The code between the if-end keywords is executed only if the expression
condition evaluates to true.

in this case, if 2 + 2 == 4 ("==" is an equal sign) then "it's true" will be displayed

Basic operators:

# if-else

If you continue the if statement, you can write an expression that will be
will be fulfilled if the condition has not been fulfilled correctly. To do this, use the key
else word.

The code between the words else and if is executed if the condition
evaluates to false or nil.
