# What is Cycle?

A looping algorithm is an algorithm in which a set of instructions is repeated a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

In cyclic algorithms, one can distinguish the following
mandatory components:

* condition
* loop body
* counter

Depending on where the condition is (up to the body
cycle or after), cycles can be divided into cycles

with a postcondition and loops with a precondition.

While loop: the body of the loop is executed
while a certain condition
evaluates to true.

If, as a condition for this cycle, we set


parameter - true, the loop will be infinite
(run an infinite number of times).

Output:

Hello, world!

Hello, world!

Hello, world!

Hello, world!


A while loop’s conditional is separated from code by the reserved word do, a newline, backslash, or a semicolon.
Of course, there are still some more cycles, but we'll talk about them later.



To make an infinite loop, you need to write "while" "TRUE":

# Until Cycle

Until loop: the body of the loop is executed until
until the condition becomes true (then.
is is evaluated initially as false or nil).

The condition must be placed between key
words until and do.

In most cases, a while loop is used.
Until is mainly used when
this greatly improves the readability of the code.
