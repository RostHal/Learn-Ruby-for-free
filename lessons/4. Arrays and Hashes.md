# What is Array?

Array is an ordered data structure that creates
the association between the index and the item itself.
Arrays are enclosed in square brackets, enumeration
items are separated by commas. Arrays are indexed with integers starting at 0.
Arrays are dynamic: that is, you can initially set
the size of the array (optional), but later
increase.


Various types of data can be stored in arrays in Ruby.
