# What is IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is not just a text editor. 
While text editors for code like Sublime or Atom offer many handy features like syntax highlighting, 
customizable interface, and advanced navigation, they only allow you to write code. At the very least, 
you need a compiler and a debugger to create functional applications.


IDE - includes these components, 
like a number of others. Some of them come with additional tools to automate,
test and visualize the development process. The term "integrated development environment" 
means that everything you need to turn your code into functioning applications is provided.

# Which IDE is the most suitable?
# 1. RubyMine
RubyMine provides powerful development tools that match the language of the Ruby platform and take into account the dynamic nature of the Ruby language and its standard working methods. RubyMine allows you to perform in-depth analysis of project code, offering developers a code overview and unique auto-completion features for language constructs. RubyMine offers a wide range of refactoring algorithms, taking into account the peculiarities of the Rails platform, which greatly simplifies code editing and speeds up the product development process.
The environment includes the ability to easily transform HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.

# 2. VScode
Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, 
Linux and macOS. It is positioned as a "light" code editor for cross-platform development of web and cloud applications.


Also VScode supports not a small number of languages
